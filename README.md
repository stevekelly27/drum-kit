## Features

When the user enters the page they are given the instrustion to read the index of corresponding keys and sounds and to scroll down to get full view of all pads.

The index is made up of nine lowercase letters that corrispond to the different sounds the pads trigger.


There is a volume slider over the drum pads to give the user better ease of use, to have volume accesible immediatley.


The drumpads have a transform, a transition and a hover effect in use with the ckick and keydown event listeners so the user is aware of what pad they are triggering.
