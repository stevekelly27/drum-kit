# Drum-Kit

This is a webpage for musicians who dont have the analog gear, and want to make an idea for a song or just practicing there skills/ dexterity and get the grips of finger drumming by touching the pads on an ipad or phone, or by clicking the corresponding keys on your keyboard.
There is nine pads in a 3 x 3 formation and it is loosley based on the AKAI MPD218 which are a leading brand in the industry for analog drumpads.

## Features

When the user enters the page they are given the instrustion to read the index of corresponding keys and sounds and to scroll down to get full view of all pads.

The index is made up of nine lowercase letters that corrispond to the different sounds the pads trigger.

There is a volume slider over the drum pads to give the user better ease of use, to have volume accesible immediatley.

The drumpads have a transform, a transition and a hover effect in use with the ckick and keydown event listeners so the user is aware of what pad they are triggering.

## Testing 

Throughout the development I have been continuosly testing in an iPhonr 12, a Macbook pro 13" and on a larger monitor.
I have tested on different browsers to insure there are no issues on any and was pleased to find out there was not.
i have tested on:

-Google chrome

-Safari

-Mozilla firefox

-Duck Duck Go

### Responsive design
The game has been designed using grids and flex boxes to ensure it translates well to any screen size. A few media queries have been added to accomidate for small screens. In the media query I made the Pads a bit smaller and the header a bit bigger.

### Unfixed Bugs

The main issue I was having with the code was getting the volume slider working. I spent hours reaserching and trying different methods but under the time restrictions I was under i had to leave it uncompleted and the volume slider dose not work.
I plan on fixing this and making it a feature in the future.

Idea of style of Drum Pads wass based around the AKAI MPD218.

Stack overfllow and mmdn web docks were very useful for figuring things out.
